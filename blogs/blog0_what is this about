I've recently started working on a long project that requires me to focus my reading and thinking on a very narrow topic. This blog is an attempt and a vent for me
to learn about broader topics that I'm interested in, primarily by writing about them. It's the kind of writing whose aim is to understand rather 
than to inform. Every 2-3 months I will choose a topic that I virtually know nothing about and write a longish piece about the most interesting things I learned. 
Topics will range from broad technical (e.g. energy storage, blockchain...), to intersections of economics and industry, to skills I'm interested in learning (analysing visual 
arts/fiction). Aside from this self-imposed pedagogy, I'll occasionally write some personal reflections or random thoughts of (hopefully) some value.
