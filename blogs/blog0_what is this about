I've recently started a long project that requires me to focus my reading/thinking on a very narrow topic. This blog is an attempt and a vent for me
to learn about other, broader topics that I'm interested in, primarily by writing about them. It's the kind of writing that aims to understand rather 
than to inform. 
Every 2-3 months I will explore a topic that I virtually know nothing about and then write a longish piece about the most interesting things I learned. 
Topics will range from broad technical (e.g. energy storage, blockchain...), to intersections of economics and industry, to skills I'm interested in learning (analysing visual 
arts/fiction). Aside from this self-imposed pedagogy, I'll occasionally write personal reflections or random thoughts of (hopefully) some value.

To many intriguing stories,

Omar
