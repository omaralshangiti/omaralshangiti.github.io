      <p> I've recently started a long project that requires me to focus my all reading/thinking on a very narrow field. This blog is an attempt
      to learn about other broader topics I'm interested in, primarily by writing about them. It's the kind of writing that aims to understand rather 
      than to inform.
      <br>
      <br>
      Every 2-3 months I will explore a topic that I virtually know nothing about and then document this learning journey in a longish piece. 
      Aside from this self-imposed pedagogy, I'll occasionally write personal reflections or random thoughts of (hopefully) some value.
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
      To many intriguing stories,
        <br>
